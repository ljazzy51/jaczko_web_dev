# Final Project Proposal 

**My plan** 
    - I intend on adding to my midterm project about my coffee shop 
    - I plan on adding an additional page that is more interactive and has a lot more JS
    - My plan for this page is to be almost like a "whats in the drink" so people can understand what theyre ordering better

*Example* 
    - There will be an empty coffee cup in the middle of the page and then different names of drinks on the sides
    - If you press on the word latte an the coffee cup will "fill" with the different amounts of espresso, steamed milk, and foam
    - The image of the cup will change depending on the drink chosen 

*Reasoning* 
    - I want to add this because I think that a lot of the time people recognize coffee words but they dont actually understand what they are ordering 
    - I hope that something interactive like this will help to limit the miscommunication between baristas and customers
    - I also think this will help people actually get what they want rather than what they *think* they want 

*Additionally*
    - Additionally I want to make some tweaks to my midterm and add more JS elements as well as fix the responsive sizing on some of the pages 
    - I also would like to add aditional media queries so that it is more seamless throughout different sizing 
    - Overall I think this will be enough work to qualify as a final project rather than just part of the midterm 

**See the image in the folder for an idea of what the interactive page will take after**
