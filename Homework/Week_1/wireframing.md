# Wireframing Article Response 

There are 5 main considerations to hold while you're creating a wireframe of a website or an app.

*Before designing the solution you must have clarity as to what the problem may be. These questions identify the stakeholders and the hypothetical solution. You shouldn't hesitate to pick peoples brains and make sure the quanitative and qualitative data align.* 

**Know the problem first**
**Ask questions**

1. Clarify the Problem
    - Whats the problem?
    - What is it solving?
    - How do we know this is a problem?
    - Who is this for?
    - Where will this page or tool live?
2. Workflow and Sketches 
    - Sketching is a critical stage of the design process and it can occur at any point throughout the process 
    - Sketching and redesigning is critical and iterative 
    - Sketching out screens and the workflow of the app allows you to generate questions 
    - Pinning down work flows helps to rule out issues that may occur further down the line and streamline the process 
3. Get Feedback 
    - Show *everyone* you can. Designers, developers, project managers... anyone who may have input so theres always more things to consider 
    - Getting feedback helps to intercept technichal limitations and capabilities of the team and the company 
    - Getting feedback also helps to create a timeline for the project 
    - The more the better. When in doubt, ask for feedback. 
4. Know Your Tools 
    - Once you have final sketches you must transition to a demo design and then a final design
    - Balsamiq, figma, or hand drawn models are tools that helps with wireframing 
    - Getting comfortable with the tools in your toolbox is essential to efficiency and capability 
    - Your time should be prioritized for creativity and problem solving not having to troubleshoot the tools that you work with
    - *Make your tools work for you*
5. Know Your Audience 
    - The fidelity of the wireframes must adequately spea to that of the target audience 
    - High fidelity wireframes are for people and clients who need close to reality markups
    - Low fidelity wireframes are for the people and clients who just simply need the working idea or functionality of the product 
    - If necessary, wireframes can replace prototypes or "working" models of the product
