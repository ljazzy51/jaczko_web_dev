# Midterm Reflection

- My files for seeing the demo of my website are all accessible through the midterm repo folder 
- The snippets of my code are in the reflection folder along with this markdown files 
    - For my code snippets I chose the series of nested flex boxes which was a little frustrating at first but I like the way that they turned out in the end
    - The other code snippet I chose was the embedding of the google maps link within the flexbox for the transit on the contact page.
        - This was a goal of mine to learn and while I had to pivot my initial idea a little bit I was still pretty happy with how it turned out. 
- If I had more time:
    - I would add a few more images either as content or the background of other pages because I feel like it looks a little boring sometimes 
    - I also would like to change the responsive elements a little bit more so the aesthetics carry over throughout the different sizes 
    - Overall I would just like to make the website just look more visually interesting and maybe a bit more interactive 
- Overall I think it is a good start but I would like to continue working on this for my final project
