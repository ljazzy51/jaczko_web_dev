# Midterm Proposal Concept and Brainstorming 

##  Concept -- Information 
    - The concept that I have for this midterm is to make a multipage website for the cafe that I work at.
    - The pages will include:
        - Home (About)
            - Will include pictures and desriptions of each barista 
            - Will include a little blurb about the coffee shop
        - Menu
            - Will include each menu item that we offer in the cafe
        - Goodest puppy pictures 
            - Every two weeks we have a new "Goodest Puppy" and this page will feature the pictures and names of each puppy
            - The pictures will be displayed in a gallery setting
        - Contact and Location
            - This page will include the contact information for the store as well as the location of the store and off of trains lines 

## Concept -- Skills 
    - Concepts that I have learned that will be used:
        - Navbar including the linkage to different pages 
        - Positioning of the content of each page using flex boxes 
        - The structure of each page using semantic tags 
        - Contact page set up
    - Concepts that I hope to develop more through this project:
        - Having reactive galleries with different transformations 
        - I would love to figure out how to properly embed a link that shows the transit options and map's location of the shop
