# In Class Notes 11/15/2023

**Notes for the Final Project**
- Look into css keyframe animations for the final project in order to do the coffee cup game / interactions 
- Greensock / gsap 
- Use svgs for the animations

**Notes for class**
- class="p-0 m-0 border-0" >> zeroes out all of the weird margins
- aria- control, expanded, and label are to tell screenreaders what the button does and whether its open or not
