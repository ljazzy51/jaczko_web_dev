# In Class Notes 11/15/2023

**Notes for the Final Project**
- Look into css keyframe animations for the final project in order to do the coffee cup game / interactions 
- Greensock / gsap 
- Use svgs for the animations

**Notes for class**
- class="p-0 m-0 border-0" >> zeroes out all of the weird margins
- aria- control, expanded, and label are to tell screenreaders what the button does and whether its open or not 
- The best thing you can do is reading the docs because it tells you what all of the classes do 
- You can also remove the classes and see what happens to see what the classes do
- In order to override certain aspects of the bootstrap theme you have to do a bit of trial and error and see what each of the classes do in order to find the class that changes the aspect that you desire
- d-none >> displays none until >> d-md-block >> once hits a medium size screen it displays block
- make sure all images in a carousel have the same width and height so that you dont have the weird jump while waiting for cs to load
- add styles before the script 
- inspect elements in order to find their specificity to override
