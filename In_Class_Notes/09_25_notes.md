# 09/25/2023 In Class Notes 

- Font weight 
    - 400 regular 300, 200 light

- Inline is a set size and block takes the whole width 
- Instead of adding a class to the first span you can just say span:first-child because its the first child of the list item
    - This is using css specificity 
    - Its called a sudo class selector

- You should always be grouping your stylesheets by content/material so that you dont go insane looking for something 

- Transform origin is by default in the center of the object but you can always change it 
- Transitions are always applied to the starting state and it tells you when and how something is changed 
- Rotate z performs how we think that rotate should work
    - rotating x is rotating over the x plane and looking fatter
    - rotate y is rotating over the y plane and looking skinnier 
    - rotate z is "coming out at us" and looking like it has rotated but it actually rotated over the z axis 

- Subtle patterns is a really good place for textures and tiling in the x and y as for the background image better than a flat color or a gradient 

- When we fix a position you want to bump up the z index so its always on top
