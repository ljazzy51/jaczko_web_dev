# In Class Notes - 11/06/2023

- Finals due on the week of the 13th but most likely the final presentations will be on the 15th 
    - Projects will be graded after the finals week is over so you can continue to work on  your project until after but you have to present something
- You have to load google maps API in order for the maps code to work
- Asynch functions wait. If youre hitting an api it sends you to an external source and then waiting for something to happen
