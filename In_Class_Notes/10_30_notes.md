# In class notes 10/30/2023

- If you remember anything about JS you shoukd remember how to use properly use event delegation
- transitions are always added to the starting state and the display and the opacity must be explicitly stated prior to changing them
- () => is the same as function()
- document.getElementById('hide').addEventListener('click', hideKitten); this is called chaining two event listeners together using the document 
- The target is what the event happened to and typicxally is what you want when you call for the event (event.target)
- If you have an event listener on all of the tags then to know which specific tag it happened to is to look for the target 
- toggle works with the classList not the class name 
    - If you dont have it add it if you do have it delete it 
- json (javascript object notation)
    - all the information about your nodes are stored within objects 
- mongoDB is useful for database storage 
- APIs are servers that direct you call to a database and returns something back. Its the middle layer to communicate with other pages 
- Objects are a collection of key value pairs where as arrays are lists of items 
    - can be accessed using dot notation
- Spaces and dashes dont work in a key only underscores and camelCase 
- Objects are displayed in alphabetical order and if you need it in specific order you can use an array
