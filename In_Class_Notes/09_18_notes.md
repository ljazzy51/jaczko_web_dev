- Focusing on layouts and formatting 
- margin-block-start: 0.67 em 
    - em is a unit and it could also be shown as rem which is responsive 
    - 1 rem is equal to 16px
- css specificity allows you to overriding a tag or classes with other more specific titles 
    - Allows you to control what is being styled
- use margin 0 auto to center our wrapper div within the browser window
    - 0 is for top and bottom and auto is for left and right 
- border shorthand is size style color 
- the clearfix is an invisible element that makes the wrapper fit the content
    - most of the time you use a break tag
- semantic tags are best practice in html as opposed to a bunch of divs 
- the clearfix in example two is a reusable class for when you need to clear out both sides to avoid wrapping issues 
    - this class can be used on the container or wrapper element 
    - :after is inserting the elements of this class after the content of the element with the class attatched to it 
        - Invisible display 
    - to ensure cross browser compatibility add the height and font size and content: "" (empty content)
    - visibility = hidden
- descendant selectors are for more specificity
- percentage based helps with resizable and respective space on different screen sizes and mobile vs desktop 
- containers use pixles / rems and fluid uses %
