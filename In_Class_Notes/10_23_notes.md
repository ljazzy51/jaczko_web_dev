# In Class Notes 10/23/2023

- Add a JavaScript function to the midterm project before October 29th 
- This weeks homework is to write a Javascript function and that can either be added to the midterm or just as a function and a button
- Putting the script at the end is the lazy way to make sure that everything on the page has already been loaded before trying to run the script
    - The proper way to do this is using the event listeners 
- Think of the DOM as a family tree with each thing on the tree being a node
- Grabbing an element by id is a good time to use const rather than let or a var
- Constants must be initiallized and declared at the same time because they do not change throughout the code 
- IDs are important because it allows JS to grab the content easily and accurately
