- Folders and subfolders
    - scripts, css, images

- Aside is whatever is not the main content 
- Semantic tags are a great way to transition from the basic wireframe to thinking about the html

    - https://placehold.co/300x200

- External style sheets like the css is the best to use to style each page 

- id tags in css starts with the #
