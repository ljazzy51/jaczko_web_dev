- Jumbotron is basically just the stuff that would be "above the fold" in print terms but it is basically just the stuff that would load first on the page so that you dont have to scroll to see it 
- NO CLASS TUESDAY NEXT WEEK 
- 3 wide on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- box sizing border box takes into account the borders and the padding of any element 
    - This gets rid of dealing with all of the math to properly align things on the page 
    - You still have to consider the margins but when you say 900px it will be 900px including the padding and the border so its not adding to your dimensions when you have padding and border
- When you look at the img tag the width is 100% and thats so its taking up 100% of the parent that is hosting the image like the article or div but if you said 100px the image itself would be 100%
- The height auto is to keep the aspect ratio
- 100vw is 100% of the page itself -- the viewport, whereas 100% is 100% of the parent container's size
- If you call position relative it usually means that you will be using something with absolute usually
- colorzilla is a css gradient picker
- flex basis is the flex box method of the width
